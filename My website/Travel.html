    <p>The ruins are located about 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from Mardan in Pakistan's Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province.[2] A small fortified city, dating from the same era, sits nearby.[1] The ruins also sit near a modern village known by the same name.[5] It is located around 150 metres (500 ft) atop the small hill and around 2 km (1.2 mi) from the village bazar.[4] The surrounding area is known for sugar cane, wheat, maize, vegetable, and orchard cultivation. Once remote and little visited, the site now has a road and car park, set below the ruins, and has become popular with visitors.</p>
