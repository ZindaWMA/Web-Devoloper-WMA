        <ul>
            <li>Mangoes- I find Philippine mangoes or carabao mangoes are best to use in this recipe. They have a sweeter taste, intense aroma, and smoother flesh. If you can’t find them in the U.S., the closest cultivar is the Ataulfo mangoes. Use semi-ripe mangoes for a slightly tart green mango shake version!</li>
               <li> Milk- I like to use evaporated milk as it adds a rich, deep flavor. You can substitute regular milk if you prefer. You can also use plant-based milk such as soy, almond, oat, or coconut for a vegan smoothie.</li>
               <li> Sugar- adjust the amount according to how ripe and sweet the mangoes are. You can swap it with brown sugar for a hint of molasses flavor. Or use maple, honey, or coconut sugar as an alternative sweetener.</li>
        </ul>

            Add the mango pulp to a blender, along with chilled milk, sugar and 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream. Blend to form a smooth mixture.</li>
            
           <li> Step 3 Pour into glasses
            Now pour the milkshake into two different glasses and fill them 3/4th. Add a scoop of vanilla ice cream to each glass.</li>
            
          <li>  Step 4 Garnish and serve
